# Digital Asset Platform Issue Tree

The Digital Asset Platform Issue Tree is a Python script that utilizes the Graphviz library to create a visual representation of the organizational structure and problem-solving hierarchy within a digital asset platform.

## Introduction

The issue tree is a powerful tool that helps identify, analyze, and solve complex problems across different levels of an organization. It provides a structured approach to break down problems into smaller components, prioritize actions, and allocate resources effectively.

## Getting Started

To generate the issue tree visualization, follow these steps:

1. Install Graphviz library: `pip install graphviz`
2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Digital-Asset-Platform-Issue-Tree`
4. Run the Python script: `python generate_issue_tree.py`

## Customization

You can customize the issue tree by modifying the `data` dictionary in the `generate_issue_tree.py` file. Add or remove nodes to reflect the specific departments and subcategories within your digital asset platform.

Additionally, you can update the color codes in the `color_codes` dictionary to highlight specific nodes. In the provided example, the "Technology" and "QA and Testing" nodes are assigned different colors.

## Output

The script generates a PNG image file of the issue tree named `Executive_Overview_digital_asset_platform_issue_tree.png`. This file can be viewed and shared to communicate the problem-solving hierarchy within the digital asset platform.

## Examples

An example output graph is provided in the repository to demonstrate how the issue tree visualization looks. You can find it [here](./example_output_graph.png).
